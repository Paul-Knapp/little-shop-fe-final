### Preview of App:
(Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off. gifs preferred!)

### Context:
This is a project with a backend boilerplate repo and a partially built front end, I had 5 days to build out an additional table with relations and functionality to other tables and to implement the new object type "coupons" in the front end.

### Learning Goals:
For this project I used VS code to built out additional functionality with a rails API and used postman to test endpoint functionality.

### Wins + Challenges:
For this project my greatest hurdle was understanding all of the database relationships and making use of them with activerecord. I still felt a little unsure about the processes involved with building an API going into this project and I am quite happy to report I feel a lot less unsure and much more confidant.
